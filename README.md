# grocerylist
Created a grocery list that you can edit by adding, removing, or crossing off items. 
This program allows for a person to have eight options to either, view list, add to list, mark an item as complete, remove item, remove all items from list, sort them alphabetically, print the number of items on list, or exit out of list.
